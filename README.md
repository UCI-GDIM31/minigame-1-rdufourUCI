## Devlog

I’d describe Components, GameObjects, and Scenes like parts of a 
living ecosystem. Components are the organs and senses—each one gives 
a GameObject a specific function or behavior, like sight, movement, 
or sound. GameObjects are the creatures themselves—unique beings that 
come alive when their Components work together. And Scenes are the 
habitats or worlds where all these creatures coexist and interact. 
Just as every organism and environment depends on the others to create 
balance and life, Components, GameObjects, and Scenes work together to 
form a complete, dynamic game world.
